# Laboratory Projects Overview

## Introduction

This repository contains a series of laboratory projects developed using React and TypeScript. Each project focuses on different aspects of web development, providing practical experience with various technologies and techniques.

## Projects

### 1. [Memory Cards](Lab01/memory-cards)

- **Description**: A memory card game where users flip cards to find matching pairs. The game is designed to enhance understanding of React component structure and state management.
- **Features**: Card flipping, match detection, scoring system, and a timer.

### 2. [Speech Recognition](Lab02/speech-recogition)

- **Description**: A project demonstrating the use of the browser's Speech Recognition API to convert speech to text. It includes a custom React hook for managing speech recognition.
- **Features**: Real-time speech-to-text conversion, start/stop listening controls.

### 3. [Booking Form](Lab03/booking-form)

- **Description**: A dynamic booking form inspired by travel booking websites. It allows users to input various parameters for their trip, with validation to ensure all required fields are filled out correctly.
- **Features**: Destination selection, date selection with flexible options, guest and room counters, and validation.

### 4. [Redirect Guard](Lab04/redirect-guard)

- **Description**: A project that implements a mechanism to confirm user intent before redirecting to external links. It uses a popup to ask for user confirmation.
- **Features**: External link handling, popup confirmation, context API usage, and responsive design.

### 5. [Library Manager](Lab05/library-manager)

- **Description**: A single-page application for managing a collection of books. It demonstrates the use of RTK Query for state management and API interactions.
- **Features**: Book management (add, update, delete), filtering by title or author, and modular component structure.

### 6. [Advanced React Practices](Lab05/library-manager)

- **Description**: This project focuses on advanced React practices such as context, memoization, and code organization. It builds upon the Library Manager project to demonstrate best practices in component-oriented programming.
- **Features**: 
  - **State Management**: Utilizes RTK Query for efficient server-side state management.
  - **Lazy Loading**: Implements `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for performance optimization.
  - **Performance Optimization**: Uses `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `useDebounce` to enhance performance and reduce unnecessary re-renders.
  - **Context API**: Manages global state, such as theme settings, without additional libraries.
